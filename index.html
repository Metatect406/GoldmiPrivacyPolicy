    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 2024-11-20</p>
    <p>Goldmi ("the App") values your privacy and is committed to providing a secure, private experience. This Privacy Policy outlines how the App operates and reassures you of our privacy-first approach.</p>
    
    <h2>1. No Data Collection</h2>
    <p>The App does not collect, store, or share any personal or usage data. All your activity within the App is private and remains entirely on your device. We have no access to or interest in your data.</p>
    
    <h2>2. No Permissions Required</h2>
    <p>The App does not request or require any permissions from your device. It runs independently without accessing features like your camera, microphone, contacts, or location.</p>
    
    <h2>3. No Ads or Tracking</h2>
    <p>The App is a one-time purchase and contains no advertisements, tracking, or analytics tools. Your experience is free from interruptions, and your privacy is fully respected.</p>
    
    <h2>4. No Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App does not use or interact with any third-party APIs, integrations, or services. There is no external data exchange of any kind.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Permanent Privacy Commitment</h2>
    <p>We are committed to never introducing data collection, advertisements, tracking, or permissions into the App in the future. What you see now is what you’ll always get—a private, simple app experience.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>While the App itself will never change to compromise your privacy, this Privacy Policy may be updated to provide additional clarity or comply with legal requirements. Any updates will reflect our continued commitment to privacy.</p>
